# Validation Conclusion

## Learning Goals

- Use SQLAlchemy constraints and validators to validate data.

***

## Key Vocab

- **Validation**: Validation is an automatic check to ensure that data entered is sensible and feasible.
- **Form**: An HTML form is used to collect user input. The user input is most often sent to a server for processing.

***

## Conclusion

Data integrity is important because as developers we want to know what we are receiving from our programs and databases because
surprises can break our code. In the previous lessons we learned about database level validation using SQLAlchemy constraints and
we learned about Python level validation of data using the validator method. Combining these methods and techniques
can help us write code that is less prone to bugs and unexpected crashes.
